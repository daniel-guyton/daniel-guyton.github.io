				<h1 class="identityheaders">How has culture influenced my Identity</h1>
				<p>I've have lived In New Zealand my entire life, The Maori religion was a huge part of my mums 
					family and has taught me a lot about the significance of whanau and how you should always respect them. 
					This has molded and shaped my identity and I will always be grateful.</p>
				<h1 class="identityheaders">What are my values?</h1>
				<p><b>Sucess</b>, This is a huge value to me cause I'm always trying to chase success. Success is something I have always aspired. Success 
					can mean many different things to different people but to me I view success not by materialistic worth but what your goals are in life always aiming to succeed in them.
				</p>
				<p><b>Adventure</b>, Adventure to me isn't about going outside and hiking or sky diving but about putting yourself out 
					of your comfort zone in general. Every adventure can leave you happy or sad memories but ultimately it allows you to learn and shape yourself better as a person. 
				</p>
				<h1 class="identityheaders">What are my strengths?</h1>
				<p>One of my strengths is being able to learn quickly and able to recall the information. The more interested I am in learning something the quicker I will pick it up.
