					<h1>Discuss what a growth mindset is and why it is relevant?</h1>
					<p>	A growth mindset is where we believe that our brainpower can be improved with effort and the right plan/strategy. Its important because a growth mindset 
          encourages risk taking without worrying about failure because mistakes are a chance to learn.</p>
					<h1>In this exploration did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>
					<p>I never really understood much about a growth mindset but by understanding how much of 
            an impact it has on your brain and cognitive skills did surprise me. </p>
					<h1>How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h1>
					<p>I can integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey By viewing obstacles as opportunities and allowing 
            myself to normalize struggle and also believe in my ability to achieve and 
          </p>
					<p>Understanding neuroplasticity can benefit people by developing new neural pathways and allowing the brain the ability to grow and learn new things</p>
					<h1>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h1>
					<p>With time and patience I would like to use neuroplasticity so that I can improve my cognitive abilities and learning efficiency</p>
					<h1>What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h1>
					<p>	Continuing to practice and learn can create more solid connections in the brain. Some ways to improve neuroplasticity include sleeping, exercise, socializing and many more
            Sleep - An adequate amount of sleep is required to allow the brain to reset connections that are important for memory and learning.
            Exercise - even taking regular walks around the block can improve cognitive benefits in learning and memory
