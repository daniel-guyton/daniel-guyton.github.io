				<h1 id="identitymaintitle">Foundations Reflections</h1>
				<h1 class="identityheaders">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and ego as a result of the core learning?</h1>
				<p>I've explored the area of identity and values. Before going into dev academy I wasn't to sure about my values and identity's as it has never crossed my mind. From the research 
          I have gathered i think that I am on the right path to creating good values going into the future.
          good core values. <br><br> Using mindfulness meditation I have learnt that i am more calm and relaxed. <br> <br> I learnt about the brain all the various ways that it can grow and learn. </p>
				<h1 class="identityheaders">What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming.</h1>
				<p>Empathy is important in learning and programming because empathy lies at the heart of emotional intelligence and is about creating stronger bonds and being aware of our personal emotions. In programming its about viewing other peoples perspectives on things.
          <br><br>
          Self awareness in programming is important because when we are self aware we are able to recognize and strengths and weaknesses making us also be able to recognize where we have room to grow.
          <br><br>
        </p>
				<h1 class="identityheaders">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
				<p>Neuroplasticity & Growth mindset. It showed me how little I know about the brain and its ability to grow.  I've also learnt that I am able to use these core learning techniques to help better my learning.
        <h1 class="identityheaders">What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</h1>
				<p>Something that was hard was grasping the concepts but mainly because I was uninterested in the core learning. But I had eventually learnt how important it was</p>
				<h1 class="identityheaders">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h1>
				<p>I think you guys are focusing on it because the tech industry isn't just looking for technical people they are look for people with core skills and the ability to interact and communicate with with others.
          I think that you guys arent only preparing us for the technical side of job but the core side.
				</p>
        <h1 class="identityheaders">Does the time you spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h1>
        <p>I think it was good it has taught me alot about myself I didnt know. I did find it a little boring at time but that is because I do prefer practicing programming. I think its necessary to learn but somehow make it a little more fun and engaging.
        </p>
        <h1 id="identitymaintitle">Learning plan</h1>
        <h1 class="identityheaders">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
        <p>My long term goal is to primarily get a job that will set me up for success doing something I enjoy. I also do have a bit of personal projects that I would like to try and tackle. I just want to make enough money so that I am able to enjoy everything in live and be able to travel the world.</p>
        <h1 class="identityheaders">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in bootcamp?</h1>
        <p>In bootcamp i feel like I will be good with the technical side of things during foundations i found that I am able to learn technical things fairly quick and efficiently.</p>
        <h1 class="identityheaders">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
        <p>The biggest challenge for me id say would be communicating with others. I am not a very sociable person but I want to better that in bootcamp</p>
        <h1 class="identityheaders">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h1>
        <p>I want to be able to take my limitations and turn the into strengths. I want to work on my socials skills and ability to interact with other people and teams. I have never been a sociable person but I want to work on it and better it during bootcamp.</p>
        <h1 class="identityheaders"> What are you expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h1>
        <p>I want to make sure the I am always working efficiently and productively so that I am never behind on work. I do not expect bootcamp to be easy but I am prepared to devote myself to getting task done. I will also make sure i reach out for help when I need it and try to be more sociable and interactive with others. I also expect myself to aquire all the technical skills that I came here for.</p>
