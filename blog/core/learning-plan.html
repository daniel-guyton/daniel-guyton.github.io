				<div class="learningplanheaders">
					<h1>Long term goal and career pathway?</h3>
					<p>Ultimately the goal is to get a job in the tech industry. I do eventually want to get into the software <br>development field but I would actually enjoy any job tech related</p>
					<h1>What skills would you like to see developed while at EDA </h1>
					<p>I would like to develop my communications skills and social skills I definitely struggle keeping a <br>conversation with someone I just met. I would like to better that at EDA.	</p>
					<h1>Strengths and limitations</h1>
					<p>I thrive underpressure when I am given a timeframe or alot of pressure to complete a task I am able <br>to handle it well and not stress. I can also have good focus and am a quick learner on things I enjoy doing.</p>
					<h1>My commitment to how I will manage workload in this programme?</h1>
					<p>I just have to make sure Im setting goals to achieve each day and just using managing my time efficiently. </p>
					<h1>My Strategy for dealing with problems?</h1>
					<p>I will take a break from anything computer related and do and exercise or  grab a bite anything <br>that will clear my head and return back to my computer with a clear head.</p>
					<h1>A commitment to how I will seek help in a timely way?</h1>
					<p>Usually I go straight to google and it usually has my answer but If I am able to find the answer I <br>will make a post in slack. If I find my self seriously stuck I will then resort to asking the facilitators.</p>
					<h1>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team?</h1>
					<p>Honesty, expect the facilitation team be honest and tell me how I can better in certain areas. <br>Also just giving general feedback about my work like "It's good" or "It could use some work. It just gives me a good sense where i am at with my work.	</p>
					<h1>Any other commitments?</h1>
					<p>I donâ€™t have any other commitments that will cause conflict with the bootcamp.</p>
