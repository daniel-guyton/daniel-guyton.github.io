      <h1 class="identityheaders">Got blocked on a simple problem</h1>
      <p>A problem I got stuck on was fizz buzz  I got to point where I just was unable to figure itout. So I googled it and looked at the different
         methods that other people were using to achieve this task. I would break it down so I could understand how the code was working.
      </p>
      <h1 class="identityheaders">Googling</h1>
      <p>googling is a great way to look at other peoples solutions to the same problem your having. You can use their solution in your own work but making sure you understand
        how it works is crucial otherwise you are not learning you are just copying. I often find myself googling quite often and I am able to find what I am looking for quickly and easily.
      </p>
      <h1 class="identityheaders">Pseudocode?</h1>
      <p>What is pseudocode? pseudocode is a description of the code you are about to write. It is important because it breaks down the code down into small sections so you are not 
        completely lost. My pseudocode isnt the best but im working on improving it by trying to break down what I am about to code as much as possible.
      </p>
      <h1 class="identityheaders">Error Messages</h1>
      <p>error messages are a good way of problem solving. It almost always points you directly to the problem. I find using error messages to solve problems super easy as it tells you exactly what is wrong with your code.
      </p>
      <h1 class="identityheaders">Console.log</h1>
      <p>console log is probably one of the best techniques. I use it to print 
        out data as I write my code so that I can test my code and see that the code im writing is actually doing what Im asking.
      </p>
      <h1 class="identityheaders">Asking peers/coaches for help</h1>
      <p> If I can not find or figure out a solution anywhere I will go to peers or my coaches for help.
